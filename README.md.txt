# DESCRIPTION #
###############

This was a data migration final project for my database development class. I have written SQL scripts using Oracle to migrate all of the data from the Northwind database and move it into an new version of the database (NorthwindUpdated) where I had integrated specific changes.

Included is a script to create and populate the original database, including my scripts to create the improved database, migrate the data, and a test script used to test data integrity. I have also included a copy of the assignment to help demonstrate what I've done.

I had created the original database under the connection 'northwindOLD' and the updated under a connection named 'northwind'.
