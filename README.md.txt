This was a data migration final project for my database development class. I have written SQL scripts using Oracle to migrate all of the data from the Northwind database and move it into an new version of the database where I had integrated specific changes.

Included is a script to create and populate the original database, including my scripts to create the improved database, and migrate the data. There is also a test script used to test data integrity.

I had created the original database under the connection 'northwindOLD' and the updated under a connection named 'northwind'.
